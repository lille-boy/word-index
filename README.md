# word-index
Creates an index of all the words used in an input file
Sorts them in alphabetical order
Next to each word, the lines where it appears are added, separated by commas

Example:
- apple 1, 5
- banana 3, 5, 12
- cherry 4

Generating the index of words makes use of a binary tree.
Adding line numbers makes use of linked lists.
